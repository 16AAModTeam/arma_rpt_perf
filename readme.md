# Extract FPS averages from an RPT

You need to have logged FPS to the RPT first. We have a tiny mod that does this. We'll get around to publishing it some day :)

# Installation of deps

```
poetry install
```

Requires poetry and Python 3: see https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#user-content-installation

# Running

```
poetry run python arma_rpt_perf.py PATH_TO_RPT
```
